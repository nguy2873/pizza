<h1>Mong's Pizza</h1>

<p>My favorite kind of pizza doesn't have a name, but it would have a lot of sauce, meat, and some fresh veggies!
I would name my favorite pizza, the Mong, just because I would be the only person who would want to eat it the most.
    My pizza would have to have the following required:</p>

<h2>Pizza Must Haves</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lots of sauce</li>
    <li>Pesto or garlic crust</li>
    <li>Lots of meat</li>
    <li>Some kind of vegetables</li>
    <li>Spice!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>These are the ingredients to my pizza:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Red Tomato Sauce</li>
    <li>Sausage</li>
    <li>Pepperoni</li>
    <li>Chicken</li>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Olives</li>
    <li>Basil</li>
    <li>Sriracha</li>
</ol>

<!--I like to share my pizza and add my own spice to each slice-->
